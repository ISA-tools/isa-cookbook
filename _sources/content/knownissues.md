Known issues
============

isatools v0.9 package
---------------------

-   Various API packages have been refactored and moved.
    `isatools.model.v1` is now in `isatools.model`. Packages
    `isatools.validate`, `isatools.config`, `isatools.schemas` have been
    removed. Some items from `isatools.convert` and `isatools.io` have
    been split into the `isatools.io` or `isatools.net` packages, where
    the latter has been created to distinguish parts of the ISA API that
    require network access
-   Issue \#153 is still outstanding since version 0.4, as per below;
    new issue \#235 where missing \`Protocol REF\`s are sometimes
    incorrectly inserted on loading ISA-Tab
-   New ISA creation functionality from planning objects in
    `isatools.create.models` currently only support a limited number of
    technology types (DNA microarray, DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry,
    and NMR)
-   SRA/ENA importer and Biocrates importer relies on XSLT2 processing
    only available with SAXON and requires .jar file to run
-   It has been decided to stop work on retrofitting support for Python
    2.7 and focus on keeping up to date with the current and future
    Python versions

isatools v0.8 package
---------------------

-   Issues \#153 is still outstanding, as per below; new issue \#208
    (ISA-Tab validation issue)
-   SRA/ENA importer and Biocrates importer relies on XSLT2 processing
    only available with SAXON and requires .jar file to run

isatools v0.7 package
---------------------

-   Issues \#101, \#153 are still outstanding, as per below
-   SRA/ENA importer and Biocrates importer relies on XSLT2 processing
    only available with SAXON and requires .jar file to run

isatools v0.6 package
---------------------

-   Issues \#146, \#101, \#153 are still outstanding, as per below
-   SRA/ENA importer and Biocrates importer relies on XSLT2 processing
    only available with SAXON and requires .jar file to run
-   We are aware that there may be some performance issues when loading
    and writing ISA-Tab documents with several thousand samples. This
    has been worked on and there is ongoing efforts to improve on the
    current performance of ISA-Tab I/O

isatools v0.5 package
---------------------

-   All issues inherited from v0.4 (see below)
-   Currently only Python 3.4 and 3.5 is supported. Python 2.7 support
    is present in the `py2` source branch on Github.

isatools v0.4 package
---------------------

-   For certain of ISA-Tab table files, the ISA-Tab parser cannot
    disambiguate between process instances where a `Name` column is
    required to qualify a `Protocol REF` has been left blank. Utility
    functions have been written to detect these anomalies and to assist
    in correcting them, in the `isatools.utils` package. \#146 (see
    detail after bullet points)
-   When converting to ISA JSON in using `UUID` or `counter` Identifier
    Types, some elements are not detected, such as `Array_Design_REF`
    \#101
-   The ISA-Tab parser does not support reading
    `Protein Assignment File`, `Peptide Assignment File`,
    `Post Translational Modification Assignment File` columns, and
    therefore the `isatab2*` converters also do not support these \#174
-   The SRA/ENA importer in `sra2isatab` relies on XSLT2 processing
    functionality only available with SAXON, so you must provide the JAR
    file yourself to use this
-   `sra2isatab` converter does not support SRA pools \#153
-   The legacy functionality (marked in the documentation) relies on
    Java 1.6

To check for possible erroneous pooling events in an ISA-Tab archive,
you can try something like:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> from isatools import utils
>>> utils.detect_isatab_process_pooling('tests/data/tab/MTBLS1/')
INFO: Converting ISA-Tab to ISA JSON...
INFO: Converting ISAtab to ISAjson for tests/data/tab/MTBLS1/
INFO: ... conversion finished.
Checking s_MTBLS1.txt
Checking a_mtbls1_metabolite_profiling_NMR_spectroscopy.txt
Possible process pooling detected on:  #process/Extraction1
Possible process pooling detected on:  #process/ADG_normalized_data.xlsx
[{'a_mtbls1_metabolite_profiling_NMR_spectroscopy.txt': ['#process/Extraction1', '#process/ADG_normalized_data.xlsx']}]
>>>
```

In this case, `#process/Extraction1` is the pooling that we did not
expect. This is a pooling on a single `Extraction`. From manual
inspection of the ISA-Tab file
`a_mtbls1_metabolite_profiling_NMR_spectroscopy.txt` we can then confirm
that values are entirely missing from `Extract Name`, causing the parser
to think the experimental graph converges on one process node. To
rectify this, individual values should be put into this `Name` column.
We can try fix erroneous pooling by filling out an empty `Name` column
with a corresponding `Protocol REF` by doing the following:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> utils.insert_distinct_parameter(open('tests/data/tab/MTBLS1/a_mtbls1_metabolite_profiling_NMR_spectroscopy.txt', 'r+'), 'Extraction')
Are you sure you want to add a column of hash values in Extract Name? Y/(N)
>? Y
```

If successful, this will fill out the empty column with 8 character-long
UUIDs (e.g. 4078cb03).

Please be aware that these utility functions
`detect_isatab_process_pooling()` and `insert_distinct_parameter()` are
there to help you manually fix your ISA-Tabs, not to automatically fix
them for you. We wil address this issue in more depth in following
releases.

isatools v0.3 package
---------------------

-   `required` constraints on JSON schemas causes validation failure for
    `@id` objects, meaning some constraints using JSON schemas cannot be
    used for validation \#108
-   Chained processes (i.e. a process followed by another process
    without any intermediate inputs and outputs, in ISAtab a
    `Protocol REF` columns followed by another `Protocol REF` columns
    without any materials in between) are not currently supported. It is
    not recommended to attempt to use such patterns with this version of
    the `isatools` package \#111
-   When converting to ISA JSON in using `UUID` or `counter` Identifier
    Types, some elements are not detected, such as `Array_Design_REF`
    \#101
-   The SRA/ENA importer in `sra2isatab` relies on XSLT2 processing
    functionality only available with SAXON, so you must provide the JAR
    file yourself to use this
-   The legacy functionality (marked in the documentation) relies on
    Java 1.6

isatools v0.2 package
---------------------

-   `required` constraints on JSON schemas causes validation failure for
    `@id` objects, meaning some constraints using JSON schemas cannot be
    used for validation \#108
-   When converting to ISA JSON in using `UUID` or `counter` Identifier
    Types, some elements are not detected, such as `Array_Design_REF`
    \#101
-   `Protocol REF` columns must be present in order for the ISA-Tab to
    JSON conversion to pick up processes in the process sequences \#111
-   Characteristics and Factor Values declared in assay tables in ISAtab
    are associated to Sample objects only. This means that when writing
    from Python objects, or converting from ISA JSON, to ISAtab these
    columns appear at the study table.
-   Chained processes (i.e. a process followed by another process
    without any intermediate inputs and outputs, in ISAtab a
    `Protocol REF` columns followed by another `Protocol REF` columns
    without any materials in between) are not currently supported. It is
    not recommended to attempt to use such patterns with this version of
    the `isatools` package \#111
-   For experimental graph patterns to work, should follow relatively
    simple patterns. e.g. Straight Sample -\> \... -\> Materials -\>
    \... -\> Data paths (per assay), or simple splitting and pooling.
    See test package code for examples of what works.
-   No ISA JSON configurations have been included that correspond with
    the following default XML configurations: `clinical_chemistry.xml`
    and most are as yet untested.

isatools v0.1 package
---------------------
