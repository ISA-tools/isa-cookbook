Study-design-driven creation of ISA content
===========================================

In addition to the basic classes for creating ISA objects (such as
`Investigation`, `Study`, `Assay` described previously), the ISA API
also provides a set of helper Python classes to bootstrap the creation
of ISA documents from key parameters obtained from the Design of
Experiment (DoE). The methods allow the creation of the study Treatment
plan, the Sample collection Plan and the study assay plan.

The core functions of the ISA-API create mode which are covered in this
section are:

-   `InterventionStudyDesign`
-   `Treatment`
-   `TreatmentFactory`
-   `TreatmentSequence`
-   `SampleAssayPlan`
-   Assay \'topology modifiers\' that support creating experimental
    graphs with specific characteristics for different technologies,
    such as `MSAssayTopologyModifiers` and
    `DNASeqAssayTopologyModifiers`

Getting started
---------------

The package containing all the classes for study-design-based creation
of ISA content is `isatools.create..model`.

To use this package, include the following import statement in your
code, which includes all the objects available in the package

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> from isatools.create.models import *
```

Alternatively, you can include specific classes and objects that you are
interested in. For example

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> from isatools.create.models import *

from isatools.create.models import (InterventionStudyDesign, Treatment,
                                Characteristic, TreatmentFactory,
                                TreatmentSequence, AssayType,
                                SampleAssayPlan, INTERVENTIONS,
                                BASE_FACTORS_ as BASE_FACTORS,
                                IsaModelObjectFactory,
                                MSAssayTopologyModifiers,
                                DNASeqAssayTopologyModifiers)
```

Currently, we only support intervention designs by creating objects of
the class `` `InterventionStudyDesign ``\` (see code snippet below). We
will soon also support observation designs.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
```

\>\>\> study\_design = InterventionStudyDesign()

The definition of [intervention
design](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000115) according to the
[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](http://obi-ontology.org/) is:

Note
:::

\"An intervention design is a study design in which a controlled process
applied to the subjects (the intervention) serves as the independent
variable manipulated by the experimentalist. The treatment (perturbation
or intervention) defined can be defined as a combination of values taken
by independent variable manipulated by the experimentalists are applied
to the recruited subjects assigned (possibly by applying specific
methods) to treatment groups. The specificity of intervention design is
the fact that independent variables are being manipulated and a response
of the biological system is evaluated via response variables as
monitored by possibly a series of assays.\"

Creation of treatments: Treatment, TreatmentFactory, TreatmentSequence
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Treatment` class is defined as a tuple of factor values (as defined
in the ISA model v1) and a treatment type.

To create a treatment object, you need to identify the `StudyFactor`s
and their `FactorValue`s as the treatment is a specific combination of
factor values:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
agent = StudyFactor(name="agent", factor_type="agent value")
intensity = StudyFactor(name="intensity", factor_type="intensity value")
duration = StudyFactor(name="duration post exposure", factor_type="duration value")


treatment = Treatment(treatment_type=INTERVENTIONS['CHEMICAL'],
    factor_values=(
        FactorValue(factor_name=agent, value='ibuprofen'),
        FactorValue(factor_name=intensity, value='low dose'),
        FactorValue(factor_name=duration, value='2 hr')
    ))
```

For convenience, a few objects are provided with some common:

-   `INTERVENTIONS` such as chemical, behavioural, surgical, biological,
    radiological, and
-   `BASE_FACTORS` representing a perturbation agent, intensity and
    duration of the treatment

but if these are not suitable for your purposes, you can build your own
intervention type and factors.

In the example above we use one of the common interventions but created
our own set of `StudyFactor`s.

Instead of creating individual treatments, you may want to create all
the treatments required for a specific design type.

The `TreatmentFactory` class provides utility methods to create a set of
`Treatment` objects. One of the utility methods is that for creating the
set of treatments corresponding to a full factorial design (using method
`compute_full_factorial_design`). This computes all the combinations of
factor values, returning an empty set if one of the factors has no
associated values.

An example of using the `TreatmentFactory` class is as follows:

``` {.sourceCode .python
treatment_factory = TreatmentFactory(factors=[agent, intensity, duration])}
treatment_factory.add_factor_value(agent, {'acetyl salicylic acid', 'acetaminophen', 'ibuprofen'})
treatment_factory.add_factor_value(intensity, {'high dose', 'low dose', 'medium dose'})
treatment_factory.add_factor_value(duration, {'2 hr', '4 hr'})

factorial_design_treatments = treatment_factory.compute_full_factorial_design()
```

The `factorial_design_treatments` object will contain the set of 18
treatments that result from performing all the combinations of the 3x3x2
factor values shown above.

A set of treatments may be combined in a `TreatmentSequence`.

The `TreatmentSequence` class provides a way of building is an ordered
sequence of treatments, where each treatment is assigned a rank, or
epoch number, with the following properties: the epoch numbers always
start with 1 (lowest epoch number), all epochs should be positive
integers, epoch numbers may be repeated (for concomitant treatments), no
value should be missing between the lowest epoch (1) and the highest
epoch.

``` {.sourceCode .python
treatment_sequence = TreatmentSequence(
ranked_treatments={ (x, (i+1)) for i, x in enumerate(factorial_design_treatments)}
)}
```

Creation of Sample and Assay Plans
----------------------------------

After you have identified the treatments, to describe your experiment
fully you will need to indicate the sampling plan (i.e. in which way you
select the samples) as well as the assay plan (i.e. what measurements
you are taken from the samples). For this purpose, we provide the
`SampleAssayPlan` class.

Taking into account the specifics of Data Acquisition events dependent on methodology and technology
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assay \'topology modifiers\' functions (such as
`MSAssayTopologyModifiers` for Mass Spectrometry based assays or
`DNASeqAssayTopologyModifiers` for DNA sequence assays) are present to
support specific branching or pooling events affecting the underlying
experimental graph, which we aim to represent with ISA objects.
Depending on the assay and the technology used to acquire data, the
number of \'hinge points\' may vary but the basic principle remains the
same. Some are common to all: for instance, irrespective of the
technique, one may carry out several data acquisition on the same input
material (technical replication). On the other hand, when using a
technique such as mass spectrometry an range of setting may be set by
the operators, such as the type of injections modes, the type of
acquisition modes. When using sequencing technology, different
instruments may be used, libraries may be prepared as single or paired
ends. The \'Topology Modifiers\' method in the ISA-API allows to specify
those in a flexible yet generic way.

We will explain each of these objects and how to use them below.
