Creating ISA content with a Sample and Assay plan
=================================================

The ISA API provides a set of classes that you can use to plan a study,
in terms of sample collection and assay run patterns. Objects of these
classes can then be used to dump ISA-Tab or ISA-JSON templates
corresponding to your study design. They are found in the
`isatools.create.models` module.

Take a look at the
[isatools-notebooks](https://github.com/ISA-tools/isatools-notebooks)
GitHub repository for Jupyter Notebook examples of using the planning
objects.
