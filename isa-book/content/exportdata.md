# Exporting data from ISA formats
----------------------------------
+++
We have provided a number of modules that allow you to export data from
ISA formats to formats ready for consumption by well-known databases or
services in the following conversion modules found in the
`isatools.convert` package:

## Converting from ISA-Tab to SRA XML
----------------------------------

To convert from a directory `./tabdir/` containing valid ISA-Tab files
to a write the SRA XML files to a target directory `./outdir/`,
validating against a given configuration in
`./isaconfig-default_v2015-07-02/`:

```python
from isatools.convert import isatab2sra

sra_settings={
         "sra_broker": "MYORG",
         "sra_center": "MYORG",
         "sra_project": "MYORG",
         "sra_broker_inform_on_status": "support@myorg.org",
         "sra_broker_inform_on_error": "support@myorg.org",
         "sra_broker_contact_name": "Support"
     }

isatab2sra.convert('./tabdir/', './outdir/', sra_settings=sra_settings)
```

This method writes the SRA files out to `./outdir/`.

Note that when subitting SRA XML to ENA, you need to supply broker
information as shown above in the `sra_settings` JSON, customised to
your own organisation\'s settings.

## Converting from ISA JSON file to SRA XML
----------------------------------------

To convert from a a ISA JSON file `isa.json` directory to write out SRA
XML files to a target directory `./outdir/`:

```python
from isatools.convert import json2sra

sra_settings={
         "sra_broker": "MYORG",
         "sra_center": "MYORG",
         "sra_project": "MYORG",
         "sra_broker_inform_on_status": "support@myorg.org",
         "sra_broker_inform_on_error": "support@myorg.org",
         "sra_broker_contact_name": "Support"
     }

json2sra.convert(open('isa.json'), './outdir/', sra_settings=sra_settings)
```

This method writes the SRA files out to `./outdir/`.

Note that when subitting SRA XML to ENA, you need to supply broker
information as shown above in the `sra_settings` JSON, customised to
your own organisation\'s settings.

To turn off pre-conversion validation, use `validate_first=False`. By
default it is set to `validate_first=True`.

## Converting ISA content to SampleTab
-----------------------------------

```{warning}

As of July 2020, EBI Biosample has decommissioned SampleTab format and now only accepts submission via a REST API.
Future releases of the ISA-API will support this mode of data deposition.
```

To export metadata from SampleTab files (e.g. for EBI BioSamples
database), you can do the following to export a ISA-Tab to SampleTab:

```python
from isatools.convert import isatab2sampletab

with open('your/path/to/i_investigation.txt', 'r') as input_investigation_file:
    with open('your/path/to/sampletab.txt', 'w') as output_sampletab_file:
        isatab2sampletab.convert(input_investigation_file, output_sampletab_file)
```

To export an ISA JSON file to SampleTab, you can do:

```python
from isatools.convert import isatab2sampletab

with open('your/path/to/i_investigation.txt', 'r') as input_investigation_file:
    with open('your/path/to/sampletab.txt', 'w') as output_sampletab_file:
        isatab2sampletab.convert(input_investigation_file, output_sampletab_file)
```

You can also dump SampleTab content directly from ISA Python objects:

```python
from isatools import sampletab

with open('your/path/to/sampletab.txt', 'w') as output_sampletab:
    # Note: ISA would be a previously loaded or constructed root Investigation object
    sampletab.dump(ISA, output_sampletab)
```

## Exporting ISA content to MAGE-TAB
---------------------------------

To export metadata to MAGE-TAB files (e.g. for EBI ArrayExpress
database), you can do the following to export a ISA-Tab to MAGE-TAB:

```python
from isatools.convert import isatab2magetab

with open('your/path/to/i_investigation.txt', 'r') as input_investigation_file:
    isatab2magetab.convert(input_investigation_file, 'your/output/path/')
```

To export an ISA JSON file to SampleTab, you can do:

```python
from isatools.convert import json2magetab

with open('your/path/to/i.json', 'r') as input_isajson_file:
    json2magetab.convert(input_isajson_file, 'your/output/path/')
```
